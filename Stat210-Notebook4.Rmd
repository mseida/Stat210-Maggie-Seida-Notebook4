This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

#alpha aesthetic controls the transparency of the points  
#shape aesthetic controls the shape of the points (ggplot2 will only use six shapes at a time. By default, additional groups will go unplotted when you use the shape aesthetic)
```

#the color isn't blue bc the aesthetic is inside the aes() and it needs to be outside
?mpg

#the categorical values are model, manufacturer, transmission, and drive and the continuous variableis the displacement.

#a bit of problem on this one... not sure what to set stroke = to

common problem includes misplacement of +, always has to go on first line not at beginning of second

#the dot plots without a column and repeats the y axis is repeated. In the second there is no row and the x axis is repeated. 
```
#with other geometric objects you can smooth data, find trendlines, and compress data and neaten it  
#you can also smooth certain points based on variable type or value to create different trendlines within a set of data
